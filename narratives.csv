"AM/FM Characterization","characterization","1","1","protagonist/love interest/peer","identity/backstory/emotion/memory/attraction/friendship","Music can convey a lot more than just what's in the lyrics, so matching this song with the {CHARACTER_0}'s character, while a bit of a cheat, is a fantastic way to convey a lot about them in not a lot of time. A mousy librarian suddenly takes on a wilder angle when their iPod is blaring Joan Jett and the Blackhearts.","https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AMFMCharacterization"
"Campfire Character Exploration","characterization","1","NA","protagonist/peer/love interest","memory/backstory/friendship/attraction/identity/kissing","What better way is there to squeeze in some character revelations than a nice, calm campfire right before they drift off to sleep? The mood and lighting of the fire and the nighttime sky are good settings already, and {REMAINING_CHARACTERS} might also have some hidden secrets or pent-up stress that they'd like to share.","https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CampfireCharacterExploration"
"Elite School Means Elite Brain","characterization","1","1","protagonist/peer/mentor/antagonist","school/backstory/identity","If a character's education includes prestigious schools, it means they're the smartest person in the room. It's often an easy way for authors to write a smart character. Portraying the {CHARACTER_0} cleverly solving problems and engaging in a subject well above the writer's understanding of the topic can be difficult. Saying the {CHARACTER_0} went to Harvard is not.","https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EliteSchoolMeansEliteBrain"
"Literal Transformative Experience","characterization","1","1","protagonist/antagonist","prophecy/immortality/identity/backstory","The {CHARACTER_0} develops as a result of a physical transformation and the experiences therein.

"Misery Builds Character","characterization","1","1","protagonist/peer","disaster/hatred/emotion/identity","The suffering that the {CHARACTER_0} goes through is believed to help their personal and spiritual development, though often in a vague, unspecified manner. When done right, this trope proves that someone can grow and mature once they've had their share of humble pie or have suffered enough to move themselves in a more positive direction.","https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MiseryBuildsCharacter"
"Playing Catch with the Old Man","characterization","2","2","protagonist,mentor","family/backstory/memory","In fiction, a game of catch always shows the relationship between the {CHARACTER_0} and the {CHARACTER_1}. The most common type is a father-figure with their child. If the parent playing catch is a mother-figure instead, it can reveal she has to play the roles of both father and mother because the father isn't in the picture or that Mom is a bit tomboyish.","https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayingCatchWithTheOldMan"
"A Shared Suffering","characterization","2","2","protagonist,peer/mentor/antagonist","backstory/emotion/friendship/attraction/tragedy","Sometimes a character like the {CHARACTER_0} will be having a rough time. However, there may be someone who can really understand what they're going through, such as someone they're close to, but not necessarily... like the {CHARACTER_1}. Either way, the two commiserate over similar struggles.","https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ASharedSuffering"

"There Can Be Only One","plot","3","NA","peer/protagonist/antagonist","murder/betrayal/combat/disaster/hatred/rivalry/revenge/death","The long-term plot of the program revolves around a group of characters – {REMAINING_CHARACTERS} – whose numbers are being slowly whittled away by one means or another, usually by killing each other. In the case of some reality shows, this is a process of elimination intended to result in a single winner.","https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereCanBeOnlyOne"
"Zombie Apocalypse","plot","2","NA","peer/protagonist/antagonist","apocalyptic/combat/haunted/death/immortality/disaster","The recently dead have risen, en masse, to feed on the living.

"How Dad Met Mom","plot","1","1","protagonist/peer","marriage/family/backstory/memory/attraction","Simply put, an episode/chapter/scene/whatever detailing how the {CHARACTER_0}'s parents met, almost always in the form of the child or children being told the story by one of the parents. This trope usually comes into play when at least one of the parents is an important character, and thus worthy of giving an explanation on how they ended up having a child with the other character.","https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HowDadMetMom"
"Reincarnation Romance","plot","2","2","protagonist,love interest","immortality/afterlife/attraction/death/prophecy/obsession/haunted","You know the drill. A love so strong it conquered time!

The {CHARACTER_1} may at some point in the episode become the Damsel in Distress, but if not, they're either the perp or will be suspected of being the perp.

A standard response in the face of an accusation that two characters, the {CHARACTER_0} and {CHARACTER_1}, are more than Just Friends. Usually said with an exclamation point or ten, and emphasis on the NOT, maybe accompanied by breaking something.","https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SheIsNotMyGirlfriend"
"Parental Marriage Veto","plot","2","2","protagonist/peer,love interest/mentor/antagonist","marriage/family/dating","The {CHARACTER_0} is a grown adult. They've found their true love, the {CHARACTER_1}, who loves them back. They want to get married. Everything's great, right? Wrong!

"Auto-Incorrect","plot","2","2","protagonist,peer/love interest","technological/disaster/friendship","Autocorrect and speech-to-text software are a great help to users of electronic devices, but they're not perfect.

Betcha scared now, huh?!","https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HauntedTechnology"
"Aliens Never Invented the Wheel","setting","NA","NA","NA","technological/backstory/identity","It's more difficult to pass off an alien culture or that of an Alternate Universe Earth as fundamentally different from humanity by introducing a unique set of Technology Levels and social traits than to just have them lack something humans have. Wouldn't it feel alien to be asked what a table does or what the strange noise patterns that emerge from your iPod are?","https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AliensNeverInventedTheWheel"
"Fallen States of America","setting","NA","NA","NA","disaster/apocalyptic/tragedy","A common way to create a Crapsack World setting is to have the United States fall so much that it becomes much like a third world nation, with a collapsed economy, decaying infrastructure, fallen or incredibly corrupt government, and so on.","https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FallenStatesOfAmerica"
"Doomsday Clock","setting","NA","NA","NA","prophecy/apocalyptic/disaster/death","This handy metaphor is pulled out of the writer's bag of tricks whenever we need to be shown that time is of the essence in a particular dilemma.
